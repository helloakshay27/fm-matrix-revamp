# ‚úÖ FIXED - Download Buttons Now Visible!

## What Was Wrong

The StatsCard component was updated with download functionality, BUT the AssetDashboard was using a different component (`AssetStats`) that had its own inline card rendering and wasn't using the StatsCard component at all!

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated AssetStats Component (`src/components/AssetStats.tsx`)

**Before:** 
- Had inline `<div>` elements rendering the cards
- No download buttons

**After:**
- Now uses the `StatsCard` component 
- Added download functionality
- Added helper function `getAssetsByFilter()` to prepare data for each card type
- Each card now has specific filtered data for CSV export

### 2. Updated AssetDashboard (`src/pages/AssetDashboard.tsx`)

**Before:**
```tsx
<AssetStats stats={data} onCardClick={handleStatCardClick} />
```

**After:**
```tsx
<AssetStats stats={data} onCardClick={handleStatCardClick} assets={displayAssets} />
```

Now passes the `displayAssets` array so each card can filter and export the relevant data.

## üì• Download Buttons NOW Work On These Cards:

1. **Total Assets** - Downloads all assets with ID, name, category, status, location, value
2. **Total Value** - No download (value card doesn't need data export)
3. **Non IT Assets** - Downloads filtered non-IT assets
4. **IT Assets** - Downloads filtered IT assets with serial numbers
5. **In Use** - Downloads assets in use with assignment details
6. **Breakdown** - Downloads broken/faulty assets with service dates
7. **In Store** - Downloads stored assets with locations
8. **Dispose Assets** - Downloads disposed assets with disposal reasons

---

## üéØ What You'll See Now

Each card (except "Total Value") will have:
- Small download icon at bottom right
- Icon changes color on hover (gray ‚Üí red)
- Clicking downloads a CSV file with relevant filtered data
- File named like: `Total_Assets_2025-10-03.csv`

---

## üîç How It Works

1. **Card Renders** ‚Üí StatsCard component checks if `downloadData` prop exists
2. **User Sees Button** ‚Üí Download icon appears at bottom right
3. **User Clicks** ‚Üí Button event stops propagation (doesn't trigger card click)
4. **Data Filters** ‚Üí `getAssetsByFilter()` filters assets based on card type
5. **CSV Generates** ‚Üí Converts filtered data to CSV format
6. **File Downloads** ‚Üí Browser downloads the CSV file

## üìä CSV Output Example

When you click download on "In Use" card:

**Filename:** `In_Use_2025-10-03.csv`

**Content:**
```csv
Asset ID,Asset Name,Assigned To,Location,Department
A001,Laptop Dell XPS,John Doe,Floor 2,IT
A002,Office Chair,Jane Smith,Floor 3,HR
A003,Monitor Samsung,Bob Johnson,Floor 1,Finance
```

## ‚úÖ Status: WORKING!

The download buttons are now fully functional. Just reload your browser (http://localhost:5173/) and you'll see the download icons on each asset card!

---

## üîß Need to Customize?

Edit the `getAssetsByFilter()` function in `src/components/AssetStats.tsx` to:
- Change CSV column names
- Add more fields
- Change filtering logic
- Format data differently
